Common Naming Conventions in Programming
The following are common case and syntax naming practices found in programming: 
•  Camel Case - each word within a compound word name is capitalized except for the first word.  Examples: julySales, getNewReport()
•  Pascal Case - each word within a compound word name is capitalized.   Examples:  JulySales, GetNewReport()
•  Underscore or Snake Case - each word within a compound word name is separated by underscores. Often found in file names but not preferred due to the fact that underlining will happen with hypertext by default, leading to confusion. Examples: july_sales, get_new_report(), soda_springs.html
•  Kebab Case - all the letters are lower case and each word is separated by a hyphen or minus sign. Examples: july-sales, get-new-report(), soda-springs.html
